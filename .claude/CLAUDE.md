# AI Development Context for sy

**Primary entry point**: `AGENTS.md` (project root)

This file exists for Claude Code compatibility. All AI context is in:
- `AGENTS.md` — Project overview, standards, quirks
- `ai/STATUS.md` — Current state
- `ai/DESIGN.md` — Architecture
- `ai/DECISIONS.md` — Decision rationale

## Quick Start

```
@AGENTS.md
```

## Versioning Philosophy

sy is a file sync tool - data safety is paramount.

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| 0.1.x | Production-ready, proven basics |
| 0.2.x | Feature complete for common use cases |
| 1.0.0 | Battle-tested, stable API |

Conservative versioning protects users. Features ship when ready, versions bump when proven.
