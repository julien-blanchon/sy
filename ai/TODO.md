# TODO

_Last Updated: 2025-11-10_

## Active Work

### High Priority

- [ ] **CI/CD Infrastructure** (v0.0.58)
  - [ ] Create simplified CI workflow for macOS + Linux + Windows
  - [ ] Run tests on 3 platforms (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest)
  - [ ] Add clippy and rustfmt checks
  - [ ] Keep it simple - no multi-version testing, no coverage reports
  - **Goal**: Catch cross-platform regressions automatically

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **S3 Testing & Stabilization** (Future)
  - [ ] Migrate to `object_store` crate (Apache Arrow project)
    - Unified API for S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage
    - Better abstraction than raw aws-sdk-s3
    - Battle-tested (used by DataFusion, Delta Lake, InfluxDB)
  - [ ] Add integration tests for S3 sync
  - [ ] Test with AWS, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, Wasabi
  - [ ] Document authentication patterns
  - [ ] Remove "experimental" tag once proven stable

- [ ] **Performance Profiling** (Future)
  - [ ] Profile large-scale syncs (100K+ files)
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks in parallel transfers
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage for massive directories

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Windows Platform Testing** (Future)
  - [ ] Test ACLs on Windows (different from POSIX)
  - [ ] Test NTFS-specific features
  - [ ] Verify extended attributes work correctly

## Recently Completed (v0.0.57)

- [x] **Issue #2: Rsync-compatible trailing slash semantics** (PR #5)
  - [x] Implement trailing slash detection for SyncPath
  - [x] Add destination path computation logic
  - [x] Add comprehensive tests (5 tests)
  - [x] Works across local, SSH, and S3 transports

- [x] **Issue #4: Remote sync nested file creation** (PR #4)
  - [x] Fix DualTransport cross-transport copy
  - [x] Add parent directory creation
  - [x] Add regression tests

- [x] **Documentation Overhaul** (v0.0.57)
  - [x] Rewrite README.md (1161 → 198 lines)
  - [x] Create docs/FEATURES.md (861 lines)
  - [x] Create docs/USAGE.md (1139 lines)
  - [x] Mark S3 as experimental
  - [x] Simplify comparison tables (rsync only)

- [x] **OpenSSL Cross-Platform Fix** (v0.0.57)
  - [x] Revert vendored OpenSSL to system OpenSSL
  - [x] Test on macOS (465 tests passing)
  - [x] Test on Fedora (462 tests passing)

## Backlog (Future Versions)

### Features
- [ ] Parallel chunk transfers within single files
- [ ] Network speed detection for adaptive compression
- [ ] Periodic checkpointing during long syncs
- [ ] S3 bidirectional sync support
- [ ] Multi-destination sync (one source → multiple destinations)

### Optimizations
- [ ] SIMD acceleration for checksums
- [ ] Zero-copy optimizations where possible
- [ ] Further memory reduction for massive scale

### Platform Support
- [ ] Windows native builds and testing
- [ ] BSD platform support
- [ ] Android/Termux support
