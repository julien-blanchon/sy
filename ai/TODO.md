_Last Updated: 2025-11-13_

## Active Work

### High Priority

    - [x] Critical bug fixes complete (memory, checksums, resume, force-delete)
    - [x] Performance improvements (DualTransport, S3, compression limit)
    - [x] All clippy warnings resolved
    - [ ] Wait for CI to pass
    - [ ] Merge PR
  - [ ] Merge PR for ACL feature
    - [x] ACL optional feature complete
    - [x] All tests passing (465 tests)
    - [x] Docker portability tests passing
    - [x] Documentation updated (README, CONTRIBUTING)
    - [ ] Create PR for `feat/optional-acls`
    - [ ] Wait for CI to pass
    - [ ] Merge PR
  - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
  - [ ] Tag and release

- [ ] **CI/CD Infrastructure** (v0.0.60)
  - [ ] Create simplified CI workflow for macOS + Linux
  - [ ] Run tests on 2 platforms (ubuntu-latest, macos-latest)
  - [ ] Add clippy and rustfmt checks
  - [ ] Keep it simple - no multi-version testing, no coverage reports
  - [ ] Document Windows as untested (experimental support)
  - **Goal**: Catch cross-platform regressions automatically

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Optional Features for Portability** (v0.0.60)
  - [ ] SSH optional but default (`default = ["ssh"]`)
    - Makes local-only builds possible with zero system deps
    - Requires libssh2 on Linux when enabled
    - Effort: 2-3 hours (similar to ACLs)
  - [ ] notify optional but default (`default = ["ssh", "watch"]`)
    - Pure Rust, no system deps, but allows minimal builds
    - For `--watch` mode continuous sync
    - Effort: 1-2 hours
  - **Goal**: Minimal builds possible, but default includes all common features



- [ ] **Auto-deploy sy-remote on SSH connections** (Future PR)
  - **Problem**: sy fails with "command not found" if sy-remote isn't installed on remote server
  - **Current**: User must manually `cargo install sy` on every remote server first
  - **Solution**: Auto-deploy sy-remote binary over SSH (copy from local machine)
  - **Edge cases to handle**:
    - Remote OS detection (Linux/macOS/BSD)
    - Architecture detection (x86_64/arm64/etc)
    - PATH setup (~/.cargo/bin)
    - Binary compatibility verification
    - Permission handling
  - **Alternative approaches**:
    1. Pre-flight check with helpful error message
    2. Auto-deploy prebuilt binaries (best UX, like rsync)
    3. Auto-build on remote (slow, requires Rust toolchain)
  - **Ref**: src/transport/ssh.rs:268-271 (error handling location)

- [ ] **russh Migration** (v0.0.59) - WIP on `feature/russh-migration` branch
  - [x] Dependencies updated (ssh2 → russh + russh-sftp + russh-keys)
  - [x] Connection handling rewritten
  - [x] Simple SFTP operations converted
  - [ ] SFTP file streaming conversion (~48 errors remaining)
  - [ ] Test SSH sync operations
  - **Branch**: `feature/russh-migration`
  - **Benefit**: 100% pure Rust stack (no C dependencies)
  - **See**: `ai/russh-migration.md` (on feature branch)

- [ ] **Performance Profiling** (Future)
  - [ ] Profile large-scale syncs (100K+ files)
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks in parallel transfers
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage for massive directories

### Low Priority

- [ ] **S3/Cloud Testing** (Future)
  - [x] Migrate to `object_store` crate ✅
  - [ ] Add integration tests for S3 sync
  - [ ] Test with AWS, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, Wasabi
  - [ ] Document authentication patterns
  - [ ] Remove "experimental" tag once proven stable

- [ ] **Windows Platform Support** (Future)
  - [ ] Implement sparse file detection on Windows
    - Use `DeviceIoControl` with `FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES`
    - Currently falls back to regular copy (Unix-only implementation)
  - [ ] Test ACLs on Windows (different from POSIX)
  - [ ] Test NTFS-specific features
  - [ ] Verify extended attributes work correctly

## Recently Completed (v0.0.59)

- [x] **Critical Bug Fixes** ✅ (PR #2, branch: `claude/fix-sy-critical-bugs-011CV5prdUFzoZGEKHyRrajn`)
  - [x] Fixed memory bug in file verification (10GB RAM → 2MB RAM)
  - [x] Fixed remote checksum failure (added sy-remote file-checksum)
  - [x] Fixed stale resume states (7-day auto-cleanup)
  - [x] Fixed unsafe force-delete (10K file threshold + explicit confirmation)

  - [x] Added S3 streaming uploads (10GB RAM → 5MB RAM)
  - [x] Added compression size limit (256MB)
