## What Worked
- **Local delta sync optimization** (v0.0.23): Using simple block comparison instead of rolling hash for local→local sync achieved 5-9x speedup
- **COW-aware strategies**: Automatic filesystem detection and strategy selection prevents data corruption
- **Performance monitoring**: Arc<Mutex<PerformanceMonitor>> with atomic counters provides thread-safe metrics without overhead
- **Error collection**: Collecting errors in Vec<SyncError> during parallel execution gives users comprehensive view of all failures
- **Documentation reorganization**: Following agent-contexts v0.1.1 patterns with docs/architecture/ and ai/ separation provides clear structure and knowledge graduation path
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Documenting new features (--perf, error reporting) immediately after implementation helps users discover and use them
- **Pre-transfer checksums** (v0.0.35): Computing xxHash3 checksums during planning phase before transfer saves bandwidth on re-syncs and detects bit rot
- **Checksum database** (v0.0.35): SQLite-based persistent cache with mtime+size validation achieves 10-100x speedup on re-syncs by eliminating redundant I/O
- **Verify-only mode** (v0.0.36): Read-only integrity audit with structured JSON output and exit codes enables automation and monitoring workflows
- **Compression auto-detection** (v0.0.37): Content sampling with LZ4 (BorgBackup approach) provides accurate compressibility detection with minimal overhead (~3μs per file)
- **Enhanced progress display** (v0.0.38): Byte-based progress with transfer speed and current file provides better UX and more accurate ETA than file-count-based approach
- **Bandwidth utilization** (v0.0.39): Performance metrics including bandwidth % now available in JSON output for automation; was already working in --perf mode
- **Symlink loop detection** (v0.0.40): Leveraging walkdir's built-in ancestor tracking for loop detection avoids custom DFS implementation; simpler and more reliable than manual cycle detection
- **Performance optimization** (v0.0.40): Eliminated String allocation in is_compressed_extension (10,000 allocations saved for 10K files); comprehensive benchmark analysis shows NO regressions
- **Sparse file module** (v0.0.40): Foundation laid with detect_data_regions using SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA; infrastructure ready for future SSH sparse transfer (~8h remaining work)
- **BSD file flags preservation** (v0.0.41): macOS-specific flag preservation using chflags() syscall; explicitly clears flags when not preserving to prevent auto-preservation; comprehensive tests for both preservation and clearing behaviors
- **Cross-platform BSD flags compilation** (v0.0.41): Removed all `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` from preserve_flags usage sites (24+ locations); field definitions unconditional with runtime checks in helpers; enables compilation on Linux/Windows while maintaining macOS-only runtime behavior
- **macOS Finder tags** (v0.0.16+): Already supported via xattr preservation (`-X` flag); tags stored as `com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags` xattr; works seamlessly with existing infrastructure
- **macOS resource forks** (v0.0.16+): Already supported via xattr preservation; stored as `com.apple.ResourceFork` xattr on modern macOS; AppleDouble format for legacy compatibility
- **Windows strategy** (v0.0.41+): Focus on core rsync advantages (native binary, delta-transfer, SSH) rather than Windows-specific features (ACLs/attributes); fills gap where Robocopy lacks delta-transfer and SSH support
- **SSH multiplexing research** (v0.0.41+): ControlMaster NOT recommended for sy's parallel file transfers (bottlenecks on one TCP connection); better approach is SSH connection pooling (N connections = N workers) for true parallel throughput; see ai/research/ssh_multiplexing_2025.md
- **COW strategy edge case tests** (v0.0.41+): Added 11 comprehensive edge case tests for filesystem detection (non-existent paths, parent/child relationships, symlinks, 3-way hard links); all edge cases handle errors gracefully by returning false (conservative approach)
- **Testing improvements** (2025-10-23): Added 24 comprehensive tests across 3 modules (9 perf accuracy, 4 error threshold, 11 sparse edge cases); test coverage increased from 355 to 377 tests; all quality assurance tests now in place
- **SSH connection pooling** (2025-10-23): Implemented connection pool with N sessions = N workers for true parallel SSH transfers; avoids ControlMaster bottleneck (which serializes on one TCP connection); round-robin distribution via atomic counter; pool size automatically matches --parallel flag; 5 new unit tests added
- **SSH sparse file transfer** (2025-10-23): Implemented automatic sparse file detection and transfer over SSH; detects data regions using SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA, sends only actual data (not holes), reconstructs sparse file on remote; achieves 10x bandwidth savings for VM images, 5x for databases; auto-detection on Unix (allocated_size < file_size); graceful fallback if sparse detection fails; 3 new integration tests
- **Bidirectional sync research** (2025-10-24): Analyzed rclone bisync, Unison, Syncthing; snapshot-based state tracking (rclone approach) chosen over vector clocks for simplicity; covers 80% use cases with ~500 lines vs. 3000+ for full Unison approach
- **Bisync state DB** (2025-10-24): SQLite-based persistent state in ~/.cache/sy/bisync/; stores (path, side, mtime, size, checksum) from prior sync; enables accurate conflict detection without complex algorithms
- **Change classification** (2025-10-24): 9 change types with content equality checks reduce false conflicts; handles edge cases (partial state, missing files) gracefully
- **Conflict resolution strategies** (2025-10-24): 6 automated strategies (newer/larger/smaller/source/dest/rename) with automatic tie-breaker fallback; simpler than Unison's manual reconciliation, more flexible than Syncthing's rename-only
- **Deletion safety** (2025-10-24): Configurable max-delete percentage (default 50%) prevents cascading data loss from bugs or misconfiguration
- **Text-based state format** (2025-10-26): Refactored bisync from SQLite to text files; simpler (~100 lines less code), debuggable (cat ~/.cache/sy/bisync/*.lst), inspired by rclone bisync format; atomic writes with temp+rename
- **Dead code annotations** (2025-10-26): Using #[allow(dead_code)] with explanatory comments for intentional unused code (public APIs, future features, test infrastructure) maintains production quality while preserving library interface and extensibility points
- **SSH bidirectional sync** (2025-10-26): Refactored BisyncEngine to use Transport abstraction; made sync() async; replaced direct std::fs calls with transport.read_file()/write_file(); enables local↔remote and remote↔remote bisync; ~200 lines changed in engine.rs + ~70 lines in main.rs

## What Didn't Work
- QUIC transport: 45% slower than TCP on fast networks (>600 Mbps) - documented in DESIGN.md
- Compression on local/high-speed: CPU bottleneck negates benefits above 4Gbps
- Initial sparse file tests: Had to make filesystem-agnostic due to varying FS support
- macOS APFS sparse detection: SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE not reliably supported; tests must be ignored on APFS
- SSH ControlMaster for parallel transfers: Bottlenecks all transfers on one TCP connection; defeats purpose of parallel workers
