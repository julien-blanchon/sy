# Status

_Last Updated: 2025-10-28_

## Current State
- Version: v0.0.50 (RELEASED - 2025-10-28) ✅
- Current Work: v0.0.51 (Resume integration) - Phase 1 in progress
- Test Coverage: 957 tests passing (444 lib + integration tests)
- Build: Passing (0 warnings, all tests green)
- Performance: 1.3x - 8.8x faster than rsync; sparse files: up to 10x faster (see docs/PERFORMANCE.md)

### Post-Release Maintenance (v0.0.50)
- ✅ Published to crates.io
- ✅ GitHub release created
- ✅ Dead code warnings resolved (commit: d122876)

### 🔄 v0.0.51 IN PROGRESS (Resume Integration)
**Goal**: Integrate TransferState into file transfers for automatic resume of interrupted large files

**Phase 1: SFTP Streaming Resume** (In Progress)
- [ ] Add resume logic to copy_file_streaming (Remote→Local)
- [ ] Implement checkpoint saving (every 10MB)
- [ ] Handle SFTP seek/append operations
- [ ] Test with large files (100MB+)

**See**: ai/research/resume_integration_v0.0.51.md for full design

### ✅ v0.0.50 COMPLETE (Network Recovery Activation)
**Goal**: Activate retry infrastructure built in v0.0.49, making it functional in production

**✅ Phase 1: All SSH/SFTP Operations Use Retry** (commits: cc9f9aa, ff3372b, b16399a)
- Converted 14 operations to use retry_with_backoff:
  - Command ops: scan, exists, create_dir_all, remove, create_hardlink, create_symlink
  - SFTP ops: read_file, write_file, get_mtime, file_info, copy_file_streaming
  - Transfer ops: copy_file, copy_sparse_file, sync_file_with_delta
- Replaced spawn_blocking + execute_command pattern with retry-wrapped async calls
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s, capped at 30s)
- Intelligent error classification (retryable vs fatal)
- All 957 tests passing
- Zero overhead when operations succeed

**Deferred to Future Releases:**
- Phase 2 (Health checks): Reactive retry via Phase 1 is sufficient
- Phase 3 (Resume integration): Deserves focused release with dedicated testing (v0.0.51+)

**Impact**: sy now automatically recovers from network interruptions without user intervention!

### ✅ v0.0.49 COMPLETE (Network Interruption Recovery Infrastructure)
**Goal**: Build infrastructure for retry and resume capabilities

**✅ Phase 1: Error Classification** (commit: 3e533a2)
- Added 4 network error types: NetworkTimeout, NetworkDisconnected, NetworkRetryable, NetworkFatal
- Implemented is_retryable() and requires_reconnection() helper methods
- Added from_ssh_io_error() to classify IO errors based on ErrorKind
- 12 comprehensive tests for error classification logic

**✅ Phase 2: Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff** (commit: 3e533a2)
- Created retry module with RetryConfig and retry_with_backoff()
- Configurable max attempts (default: 3), initial delay (default: 1s), backoff multiplier (2.0)
- Added --retry and --retry-delay CLI flags
- 9 tests for retry logic (success, failure, exhaustion, non-retryable errors)

**✅ Phase 3: Resume Capability** (commit: d266d9d)
- Created resume module with TransferState for chunked file transfer tracking
- Store resume state in ~/.cache/sy/resume/<hash>.json (hash = blake3(source + dest + mtime))
- Support 1MB default chunks with configurable size
- Automatic staleness detection (reject resume if file modified)
- CLI flags: --resume-only, --clear-resume-state
- 10 comprehensive tests for state management and chunking

**✅ Phase 4: Integration** (commit: 15789e5)
- Integrated retry config into TransportRouter and SshTransport
- All SSH operations convert IO errors to network errors for proper classification
- CLI args (--retry, --retry-delay) wired through to SSH transport layer
- Ready for automatic retry on network failures
- Foundation complete for connection pool resilience (future enhancement)

### ✅ v0.0.48 RELEASE (2025-10-27)
**Two Critical Fixes from Comprehensive Testing**

1. **Remote→Remote Bidirectional Sync** (feat: 6d9474d)
   - Previously: Explicitly rejected with "Remote-to-remote sync not yet supported"
   - Now: Dual SSH connection pools enable syncing between two SSH hosts
   - Testing: Mac→Fedora→Fedora with bidirectional changes (3 files, 59 bytes in 472ms)
   - Example: `sy -b user@host1:/path user@host2:/path`

2. **.gitignore Support Outside Git Repos** (fix: 6453681)
   - Previously: Patterns ignored in bisync (*.tmp, *.log, node_modules/ all synced)
   - Root cause: `ignore` crate's `git_ignore(true)` only works in git repos
   - Fix: Explicit `WalkBuilder::add_ignore()` for .gitignore files everywhere
   - Testing: 2 files synced vs 5 before (patterns now respected)

**Comprehensive Testing**: 23 scenarios tested over 2 hours (Mac ↔ Fedora), now 100% pass rate (up from 91.3%)

## Implemented Features

- ✅ Verify-only mode (--verify-only flag, v0.0.36) - audit integrity, JSON output, exit codes!
- ✅ Compression auto-detection (--compression-detection flag, v0.0.37) - content sampling, 10% threshold!
- ✅ Enhanced progress display (v0.0.38) - byte-based progress, transfer speed, current file!

- ✅ Symlink loop detection (v0.0.40) - safe symlink traversal with automatic cycle detection!
- ✅ BSD file flags preservation (--preserve-flags/-F flag, v0.0.41) - macOS hidden, immutable, nodump flags!
- ✅ Bidirectional sync (--bidirectional/-b flag, v0.0.43) - two-way sync with conflict resolution!
- ✅ Text-based state tracking (v0.0.44) - persistent state in ~/.cache/sy/bisync/ for accurate conflict detection!
- ✅ 6 conflict resolution strategies (v0.0.43) - newer/larger/smaller/source/dest/rename!
- ✅ SSH bidirectional sync (v0.0.46-v0.0.48) - bisync works with remote servers (local↔remote: v0.0.46, remote↔remote: v0.0.48)!

## What Worked
- **Local delta sync optimization** (v0.0.23): Using simple block comparison instead of rolling hash for local→local sync achieved 5-9x speedup
- **COW-aware strategies**: Automatic filesystem detection and strategy selection prevents data corruption
- **Performance monitoring**: Arc<Mutex<PerformanceMonitor>> with atomic counters provides thread-safe metrics without overhead
- **Error collection**: Collecting errors in Vec<SyncError> during parallel execution gives users comprehensive view of all failures
- **Documentation reorganization**: Following agent-contexts v0.1.1 patterns with docs/architecture/ and ai/ separation provides clear structure and knowledge graduation path
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Documenting new features (--perf, error reporting) immediately after implementation helps users discover and use them
- **Pre-transfer checksums** (v0.0.35): Computing xxHash3 checksums during planning phase before transfer saves bandwidth on re-syncs and detects bit rot
- **Checksum database** (v0.0.35): SQLite-based persistent cache with mtime+size validation achieves 10-100x speedup on re-syncs by eliminating redundant I/O
- **Verify-only mode** (v0.0.36): Read-only integrity audit with structured JSON output and exit codes enables automation and monitoring workflows
- **Compression auto-detection** (v0.0.37): Content sampling with LZ4 (BorgBackup approach) provides accurate compressibility detection with minimal overhead (~3μs per file)
- **Enhanced progress display** (v0.0.38): Byte-based progress with transfer speed and current file provides better UX and more accurate ETA than file-count-based approach
- **Bandwidth utilization** (v0.0.39): Performance metrics including bandwidth % now available in JSON output for automation; was already working in --perf mode
- **Symlink loop detection** (v0.0.40): Leveraging walkdir's built-in ancestor tracking for loop detection avoids custom DFS implementation; simpler and more reliable than manual cycle detection
- **Performance optimization** (v0.0.40): Eliminated String allocation in is_compressed_extension (10,000 allocations saved for 10K files); comprehensive benchmark analysis shows NO regressions
- **Sparse file module** (v0.0.40): Foundation laid with detect_data_regions using SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA; infrastructure ready for future SSH sparse transfer (~8h remaining work)
- **BSD file flags preservation** (v0.0.41): macOS-specific flag preservation using chflags() syscall; explicitly clears flags when not preserving to prevent auto-preservation; comprehensive tests for both preservation and clearing behaviors
- **Cross-platform BSD flags compilation** (v0.0.41): Removed all `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` from preserve_flags usage sites (24+ locations); field definitions unconditional with runtime checks in helpers; enables compilation on Linux/Windows while maintaining macOS-only runtime behavior
- **macOS Finder tags** (v0.0.16+): Already supported via xattr preservation (`-X` flag); tags stored as `com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags` xattr; works seamlessly with existing infrastructure
- **macOS resource forks** (v0.0.16+): Already supported via xattr preservation; stored as `com.apple.ResourceFork` xattr on modern macOS; AppleDouble format for legacy compatibility
- **Windows strategy** (v0.0.41+): Focus on core rsync advantages (native binary, delta-transfer, SSH) rather than Windows-specific features (ACLs/attributes); fills gap where Robocopy lacks delta-transfer and SSH support
- **SSH multiplexing research** (v0.0.41+): ControlMaster NOT recommended for sy's parallel file transfers (bottlenecks on one TCP connection); better approach is SSH connection pooling (N connections = N workers) for true parallel throughput; see ai/research/ssh_multiplexing_2025.md
- **COW strategy edge case tests** (v0.0.41+): Added 11 comprehensive edge case tests for filesystem detection (non-existent paths, parent/child relationships, symlinks, 3-way hard links); all edge cases handle errors gracefully by returning false (conservative approach)
- **Testing improvements** (2025-10-23): Added 24 comprehensive tests across 3 modules (9 perf accuracy, 4 error threshold, 11 sparse edge cases); test coverage increased from 355 to 377 tests; all quality assurance tests now in place
- **SSH connection pooling** (2025-10-23): Implemented connection pool with N sessions = N workers for true parallel SSH transfers; avoids ControlMaster bottleneck (which serializes on one TCP connection); round-robin distribution via atomic counter; pool size automatically matches --parallel flag; 5 new unit tests added
- **SSH sparse file transfer** (2025-10-23): Implemented automatic sparse file detection and transfer over SSH; detects data regions using SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA, sends only actual data (not holes), reconstructs sparse file on remote; achieves 10x bandwidth savings for VM images, 5x for databases; auto-detection on Unix (allocated_size < file_size); graceful fallback if sparse detection fails; 3 new integration tests
- **Bidirectional sync research** (2025-10-24): Analyzed rclone bisync, Unison, Syncthing; snapshot-based state tracking (rclone approach) chosen over vector clocks for simplicity; covers 80% use cases with ~500 lines vs. 3000+ for full Unison approach
- **Bisync state DB** (2025-10-24): SQLite-based persistent state in ~/.cache/sy/bisync/; stores (path, side, mtime, size, checksum) from prior sync; enables accurate conflict detection without complex algorithms
- **Change classification** (2025-10-24): 9 change types with content equality checks reduce false conflicts; handles edge cases (partial state, missing files) gracefully
- **Conflict resolution strategies** (2025-10-24): 6 automated strategies (newer/larger/smaller/source/dest/rename) with automatic tie-breaker fallback; simpler than Unison's manual reconciliation, more flexible than Syncthing's rename-only
- **Deletion safety** (2025-10-24): Configurable max-delete percentage (default 50%) prevents cascading data loss from bugs or misconfiguration
- **Text-based state format** (2025-10-26): Refactored bisync from SQLite to text files; simpler (~100 lines less code), debuggable (cat ~/.cache/sy/bisync/*.lst), inspired by rclone bisync format; atomic writes with temp+rename
- **Dead code annotations** (2025-10-26): Using #[allow(dead_code)] with explanatory comments for intentional unused code (public APIs, future features, test infrastructure) maintains production quality while preserving library interface and extensibility points
- **SSH bidirectional sync** (2025-10-26): Refactored BisyncEngine to use Transport abstraction; made sync() async; replaced direct std::fs calls with transport.read_file()/write_file(); enables local↔remote and remote↔remote bisync; ~200 lines changed in engine.rs + ~70 lines in main.rs
- **Real-world bisync testing** (2025-10-27): Created comprehensive test suite (bisync_real_world_test.sh) with 7 scenarios; caught critical state storage bug before release; test-driven debugging approach (create minimal failing test → trace through code → identify root cause → fix → verify all tests pass) was highly effective
- **SSH write_file() implementation** (2025-10-27): Discovered v0.0.46 shipped with broken SSH bisync (write_file not implemented); files reported as synced but never written to remote; implemented write_file() using SFTP session with recursive mkdir, file creation, mtime preservation; 89 lines; tested Mac↔Fedora over Tailscale; all 8 comprehensive tests pass including deletion propagation, conflicts, large files (10MB @ 8.27 MB/s), dry-run
- **Network error classification** (2025-10-27, v0.0.49): Systematic classification of IO errors into retryable vs fatal types using ErrorKind pattern matching; helper methods (is_retryable, requires_reconnection, from_ssh_io_error) provide clean API; comprehensive test coverage (12 tests) ensures correct classification for all error types; foundation for robust network interruption handling
- **Retry with exponential backoff** (2025-10-27, v0.0.49): Generic retry_with_backoff() function with configurable delays and backoff multiplier enables resilient network operations; CLI integration (--retry, --retry-delay flags) gives users control; 9 tests verify success, failure, exhaustion, and non-retryable scenarios; clean separation of retry logic from business logic promotes reuse

## What Didn't Work
- **Bisync state storage (2025-10-27, v0.0.46)**: Initial implementation only stored destination side state after copy operations, not both sides; caused deletions to be misclassified as "new files" and copied back instead of propagating; fixed by storing both source AND dest states after any copy
- **SSH bisync write_file missing** (2025-10-27, v0.0.46): SshTransport didn't implement write_file(), falling back to LocalTransport default which writes locally; bisync silently failed - reported success but files never reached remote; caught by real-world testing Mac↔Fedora; fixed in v0.0.47
- QUIC transport: 45% slower than TCP on fast networks (>600 Mbps) - documented in DESIGN.md
- Compression on local/high-speed: CPU bottleneck negates benefits above 4Gbps
- Initial sparse file tests: Had to make filesystem-agnostic due to varying FS support
- macOS APFS sparse detection: SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE not reliably supported; tests must be ignored on APFS
- SSH ControlMaster for parallel transfers: Bottlenecks all transfers on one TCP connection; defeats purpose of parallel workers
